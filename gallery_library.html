          <p>
            The book is completely self-contained, requiring only programming
            (in any language) as a prerequisite. Thus, it lends itself not only
            to computer science majors, but also to computer-savvy students
            seeking to gain a hands-on view of hardware architectures, operating
            systems, and modern software engineering in the framework of one
            course. The book and the accompanying Web site can also be used as a
            self-study learning unit, suitable to students from any technical or
            scientific discipline following a programming course.

            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely
            used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by
            Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
            specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major
            version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01
            version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version
            which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published
            in 2012.
